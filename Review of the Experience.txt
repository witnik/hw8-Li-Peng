Because I never thought that I would have someone else that would try to adapt our code, I did not make the code that easy to adapt. I guess next time I would really try to write the code to be more flexible and be more general instead of designer specific. I learned a lot from the code given to me. Their design simply moved the model and then gets the data from their model in the view classes. I think next time we should make the model do more work. But also now I have a better understanding toward the MVC designs.
Our provider replies quickly. Although after the first time they made changes, their code does not work anymore. And they did not notice that until we told they so. Other than that I think they are being generally helpful.
